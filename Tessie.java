    /*First we will take in the dimensions. The instructions state to assume
    the structure we are working with is a square. Therefore, we'll just ask
    for one number and assume both dimensions are that number.*/

    /*Second we will take in the god awful string of characters and praise Cthulhu.
    Since we can iterate through strings we will based on the number given to us.*/

    /*Third we will use a switch case for rotation because there are four possible
    rotations according to the instructions. No need to include Satan worship. However,
    ultimately all this will do is alter how we iterate through the array. Usually,
    you just go left to right, but we'll gown down-up, left-right, and stuff too.*/

    /* Should be easy. However, this is a WIP. I work two jobs now (one FT, one PT).
    Give me a few days. Code is easier than it looks, far easier. */
