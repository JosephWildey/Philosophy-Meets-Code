# funStuf
This is my repository for fun algorithms. I get bored sometimes or have weird thoughts I like to follow down the rabbit hole to see where they go. Keeping the code to myself is silly, so I'm also gonna drop it here. However, keep in mind code in this repository isn't always checked for compilability or meant to be optimized. There is a good chance a program won't run or there are better alternatives. Even at the same price point.
