    /*First I will take in the dimensions. The instructions state to assume
    the structure we are working with is a square. Therefore, we'll just ask
    for one number and assume both dimensions are that number.*/

    /*Second I will take in the god awful string of characters and praise Cthulhu.
    Since we can iterate through strings we will based on the number given to us.*/

    /*Third, even though the instructions mention four possible rotations: -90, 0, 90, 180,
    I will attempt to include every possible rotation from -270 to 270 in increments of 90. 
    -270, -180, -90, 0, 90, 180, 270. Since any rotation equal to 360 is also equal to 0, and any rotation greater 
    than 360 would still ultimately end up being 90, 180, or a combination thereof, positive or negative, 
    this would consider every possible rotation. I'll probably still use a switch case and
    do the math before passing it into the switch case.*/

    /* Should be easy. However, this is a WIP. I work two jobs now (one FT, one PT).
    Give me a few days. Code is easier than it looks, far easier. */
